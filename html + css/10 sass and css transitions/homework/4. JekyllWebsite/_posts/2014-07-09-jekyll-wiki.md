## Jekyll(software)
----
Jekyll is a free-software, written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner, GitHub's co-founder. Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites. It is a file-based CMS; instead of using databases, Jekyll takes the content, renders Markdown and Liquid templates, and produces a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache, Nginx or another web server. Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, a GitHub feature that allows users to host websites based on their GitHub repositories.

##Philosophy
----
According to Jekyll's "README" file:

> it does what you tell it to do no more, no less. It doesn't try to outsmart users by making bold assumptions, nor does it burden them with needless complexity and configuration. Put simply, Jekyll gets out of your way and allows you to concentrate on what truly matters: your content.
