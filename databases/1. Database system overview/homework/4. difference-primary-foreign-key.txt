Primary key is the unique key of a table, for example ID. Say, you have a student table, the primary key is usually student id, as there won't be two students with the same id. As for foreign key, it's a key to define the relationship between two tables. Say, there is another table called StudentEvent, which it contains a PersonInCharge field. In this StudentEvent table, the primary key is EventID, where the PersonInCharge is actually storing the StudentID, which it is the foreign key to the Student table. This actually defines the relationship between Student table and StudentEvent table. - See more at: http://talk.thewebhostingdir.com/microsoft-sql-server/22715-difference-between-primary-key-foreign-key.html#sthash.X3NifHsE.dpuf
